# TM112 Location Based Computing Activities

Location data plays an important role in many practical computing applications.

Use this guide to explore how we can use off-the-shelf Python packages to work with loacation data, including:

- how to call remote thrid party APIs (application programming interfaces) to retrieve locatin data from addresses or postcodes;
- use interactive maps to display location data such as markers or boundary lines.


The materials are currently presented in three main ways:

- as live interactive Jupyter notebooks running using the Compute Home service, a local Docker container, or in your browser using JupyterLite ([JupyterLite IDE](https://ouseful-demos.github.io/jupyterlite-tm112-demo/lab), [JupyterLite Notebooks](https://ouseful-demos.github.io/jupyterlite-tm112-demo/tree));
- as a static HTML Jupyter Book textbook generated from pre-run notebooks ([here](https://ouseful-demos.github.io/jupyterlite-tm112-demo/book_output));
- as in interactive HTML book supporting in-browser code execution (THIS DOCUMENT).
