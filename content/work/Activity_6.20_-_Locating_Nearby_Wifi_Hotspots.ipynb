    "# Activity 6.20 - Locating Nearby WiFi Hotspots\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as looking up cell tower locations, there are also various third party services that can be used to look up the location of WiFi hotspots from uniquely identifying information that may be disclosed by a WiFi router.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, [WiGLE: Wireless Network Mapping](https://wigle.net/) allows you to see the location of the millions of router locations in its database via an interactive map. The locations are collected by wardriving - driving along public roads, listening out for WiFi hotspots, grabbing their name (SSID) and unique identfier (BSSID) and associating them with your current location. That's why the locations on the WiGLE interactive map typically appear by the roadside. (Zoom the map to show your location to see how many hotspots have been identifed near it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way that we could in principle use a service such as the Google geolocation to look up the location of a mobile phone cell tower ([Activity 6.16 - Cell Tower Lookup.ipynb](Activity%206.16%20-%20Cell%20Tower%20Lookup.ipynb)), we can also use them to look up the location of a WiFi hotspot from its BSSID (*Basic Service Set IDentifier*).\n",
    "\n",
    "If your computer has wifi access and is in range of one or more WiFi hostpots, you may be able to identify the MAC addresses of them using the following commands. The name of each hotspot in range should be given as the SSID, and the code you need for the lookup as the BSSID. *Note that increasingly, you may find that BSSIDs are hidden.*\n",
    "\n",
    "__If you are running this notebook in the browser using JupyterLite, or the geolocation service call does not work correctly, the notebook will continue run using dummy data.__\n",
    "\n",
    "On your computer, run the appropriate command depending on the operating system you are using. *In order to detect nearby Wifi hostspots, you will need to ensure that your computer's WiFi is turned on.* The BSSID and SSID values should be displayed in the output report."
